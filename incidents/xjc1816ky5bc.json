We are investigating.</li><li><strong>2012-12-22 14:03:09</strong> - We have stabilized the network but with reduced redundancy. We are working through restoring full redundancy.</li><li><strong>2012-12-22 16:05:58</strong> - The network continues to be stable, though operating with reduced redundancy. We continue to work with our network manufacturer to restore full redundancy.</li><li><strong>2012-12-22 18:06:11</strong> - The site continues to operate normally but at reduced redundancy while we investigate the root cause of the incident this morning.
